AI Researcher · Neural State Modulation · Hierarchical Reasoning Systems

Welcome to my personal website. I work at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and complex systems, exploring how deep generative models and multi-timescale reasoning architectures can help us better understand and shape neural dynamics. This site collects a bit about who I am, what I work on, and where to find my publications.

Feel free to explore and get in touch.
